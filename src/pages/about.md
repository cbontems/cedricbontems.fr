Welcome to my website dedicated to front-end development! I'm passionate about creating amazing user experiences through web development and excited to share my knowledge and insights with you. Whether you're a beginner looking to learn the basics or an experienced developer seeking to level up your skills, this is the place for you.

## What to Expect

On this website, I aim to provide valuable resources, tutorials, and courses on a variety of front-end development topics. You can find content covering HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, WordPress, React, and Astro. I believe in a hands-on and practical approach to learning, so expect to find practical examples, code snippets, and interactive exercises to help you grasp these concepts effectively.

## Who am I?

I'm Cédric, a front-end developer with a passion for creating visually appealing and user-friendly websites. I have several years of experience working on various web projects and have gained expertise in a wide range of technologies. My goal is to simplify complex concepts and make front-end development accessible to everyone.

I am the creator and developer of [OxyProps](https://oxyprops.com), a premium WordPress plugin for Oxygen and Bricks Builders. I also run a [YouTube channel](https://youtube.com/@oxyprops) where I share tutorials and tips on WordPress and front-end development.

## Why This Website?

I created this website to share my learnings and insights with the vibrant community of front-end developers. Through tutorials and articles, I aim to contribute to the growth of aspiring developers and provide valuable resources that can empower them in their journey. Additionally, I'm exploring the possibility of offering courses to provide a structured learning experience for those looking to dive deeper into specific topics.

## Join the Community

Learning is best done together, and I encourage you to join our community. Engage with other developers, ask questions, and share your own experiences. Together, we can learn, grow, and create amazing things.

Thank you for visiting my website, and I hope you find the content here helpful and inspiring. Feel free to reach out to me with any questions, suggestions, or collaboration opportunities. Let's embark on this front-end development journey together!

Happy coding!

Cédric Bontems
